### PROJECT 1 (Colorado Ski & Board Report)

### About
The Colorado Ski & Board Report© will provide a Colorado resident or visitor quick, informative, and detailed information based on their favorite Colorado Ski Resort. Utilizing Google Map’s API to authenticate input validation, as well as the Open Weather Map API, the program will provide best route based on forecasted weather conditions.  

'On The Snow' widgets are incorporated into our program to provide detailed resort information: Resort Overview, Conditions, Web Cams, Elevation, Trail Maps, Open Terrain, Lift Availability, Snow Depth, Snowfall totals as well as links to current Resort Home Pages, Lift Ticket deals, and Lodging options. 

We've also implemented chart.js, a new technology that will provide comparison values based on user preferences and location.

### Objective
1. Use at least two APIs.
2. Use AJAX to pull data.
3. Use at least one new library or technology that we haven’t discussed. Create a polished front end/UI .
4. Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.). Do NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals).
5. Incorporate some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc.).
6. Use Bootstrap or an alternative CSS framework.
7. Deploy your site to GitHub Pages.
8. Include user input validation.
